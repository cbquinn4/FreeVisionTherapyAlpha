                    <li>Helps the eyes work better as a team.</li>
                    <li>Can reduce double vision, eye strain, and headaches.</li>
                    <li>Especially useful for conditions like strabismus (eye turn) and convergence insufficiency (difficulty focusing on near tasks).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>2. Enhanced Focus and Eye Tracking</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strengthens the ability to maintain focus on moving objects or while reading.</li>
                    <li>Helps with smooth, accurate eye movements (saccades and pursuits), crucial for reading and sports.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>3. Reduction of Visual Fatigue</strong>

                <ul>
                    <li>Vision therapy, often combined with patching or atropine drops, can improve vision in the weaker eye.</li>
                    <li>Helps the brain use both eyes together more effectively.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>5. Better Depth Perception and 3D Vision</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>For those struggling with depth perception or stereopsis, therapy can enhance 3D vision.</li>
                    <li>This is key for tasks like driving, sports, or anything requiring accurate spatial judgment.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
