    <h2>2. Near and Far Focus</h2>
    <p>Hold your thumb about 10 inches from your face and focus on it for 15 seconds, then shift your focus to something 20 feet away for another 15 seconds. Repeat 5 times.</p>

    <h2>3. Eye Circles</h2>
    <p>Sit comfortably and slowly move your eyes in a circular motion—clockwise, then counterclockwise. Repeat 10 times each direction.</p>

    <h2>4. Palming</h2>
